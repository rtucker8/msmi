# msmi

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of msmi is to use tools from multiple imputation to handle missing data
present in multistate models subject to censoring and estimate state occupation probabilities from these data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of msmi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require(remotes)) {install.packages("remotes")}
remotes::install_github("rtucker8/msmi")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the `msmi.impute` function with simulated data `sim.data`:

``` {r}
library(msmi)
head(sim.data)
head(msmi.impute(sim.data, M = 5, n.states = 3, prefix.states = c("event", "t"), method = "marginal")[[1]])
```
